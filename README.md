# auto-feature intro
A web application that helps generate features without coding with featuretools as the backbone.

# how to run the cods
1. Put the main code file __.ipynb__, all the defined functions file __utils.py__, the list of all of the project's python dependencies file __requirements.txt__ and the feature engieering pipeline diagram __pipeline.png__ in the same directory.
2. Open the main code file __.ipynb__ notebook:
    - run the __prerequisite__ section first. This part will install (pip install) the dependencies listed in __requirements.txt__ and import them into the current jupyter notebook session.
    - Then run the __Question1,2,3__ sections in a sequence to download and explore the data. For the modelling part __Question4__, the raw data will be read again (ignoring the manipulation in the first 3 questions).
